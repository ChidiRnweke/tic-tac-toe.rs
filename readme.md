# Tic-Tac-Toe in Rust

This is a simple implementation of the classic game Tic-Tac-Toe, written in Rust. I wrote it to practice basic constructs of the language and may refactor parts as I learn more. ~~For instance, when I learn how to do a while loop instead of recursion.~~

## Structure
The project is structured into several modules:
- `main.rs`: Entry point of the game that initializes the game loop.
- `logic.rs`: Contains game logic and modules related to game mechanics.
- `formatting.rs`: Handles formatting and display tasks for game elements.
- `game_loop.rs`: Manages the game loop and player interactions.
- `squares.rs`: Defines the tiles, board, and move validity.

## How to Run
To run the game, ensure you have Rust installed on your machine. Clone the repository, navigate to the directory, and type the following commands:

```
cargo build
cargo run
```
